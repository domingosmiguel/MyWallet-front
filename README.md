# **MyWallet Saas**

The main purpose of the app is to be a easy-to-use personal cash flow manager.

## **Exercised Contents**:

-   Personalized react hooks to abstract forms validation/update, axios requests, user logout, etc
-   Context to provide informations all across the app and avoid prop drilling
-   Chakra UI to easier components styling
-   Access with Google Accounts to make it easier for new users
-   Browser tab costumazation

## **Results**:

I saw in this project an opportunity to play with stylized components and Chakra UI. I implemented some cool animations and skeletons for loading data, many personalized hooks to make a more readble and maintainable code, and got a nice app.
